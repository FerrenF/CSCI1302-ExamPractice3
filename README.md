1. Using JavaFX, create a miles per gallon calculator that allows the user to enter miles and
gallons, then press a button to calculate and displays the miles per gallon based on those
values. Limit the displayed calculation to 4 decimal places.
HINT: It might be smart to “borrow” the LoanCalculator interface (not the processing code)
and modify it. Use your IDEs refactoring/renaming features for efficient completion.


2. Build a simple two-operand multi-function calculator where users choose the arithmetic
operation using a set of buttons. The user should be able to enter two numbers, then
choose the operation (using +, -, *, / buttons), and be given a result. The result of that
operation should be displayed in the interface somewhere noticeable
